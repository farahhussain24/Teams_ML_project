Data from historical Olympic games is used (which was originally on Kaggle).
To predict how many medals a country will win based on historical and current data.

Results

The performance comparison between the Linear Regression and Random Forest models reveals that the Random Forest model, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 3.89, outperforms the Linear Regression model, which has an MAE of 4.20. This indicates that the Random Forest model is better at accurately predicting the number of medals, with predictions deviating less from actual values on average. The lower MAE of the Random Forest suggests it captures the underlying relationships in the data more effectively, making it the preferable choice for this dataset. However, both models present opportunities for further optimization through hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering.
